%ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Video annotations are successfully used in many sport related areas, including training, the media coverage and sport science. The key advantages of automatic annotation over conventional manual are speed, and robustness of gathered data. However, current automatic annotations systems are not always practical due installation cost and media rights. The proposed solution provides this kind of data from broadcast videos and single camera shots.\\

The main contribution of this work is acquisition of 3D trajectory and velocity of tennis ball, including playersâ€™ positions. The 3D trajectory acquisition is based on ball detection, field lines recognition and prior information about field dimension. The accuracy is tested on all four Grand Slam tournament matches, by available ground-truth data.
